Boy and his At At wall decal.. Star Wars inspired At At on leash with boy wall decal.. Boy with Landwalker","description":"Star Wars inspired Boy walking his At At indoor wall decal.\n\nComes in two sizes and colors, please choose from the dropdown menus.\n\nIf you&#39;re a hardcore fan, this is a must for any blank wall.\n\nPLEASE READ THESE DETAILED SUGGESTIONS FOR WALL VINYL\nPRIOR TO PURCHASE. \n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE SEND ME A CONVO\nAS I HAVE TESTED THIS WALL VINYL MYSELF AND AM SO FAR VERY\nPLEASED WITH IT. \n\nCheck out this basic how to video here on applying a wall decal.\nYou&#39;ll need to copy and paste this link into your browser.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lw-196CHvWU\n\nWall graphics must be applied to a clean, smooth, dry and non-porous interior surface. Freshly applied paint\nshould be allowed to cure for a minimum of three full weeks before wall graphic application. Finished\ngraphics shipped to customers should be removed from packaging and stored flat at room temperature for\n24 hours before application.\n\nWhen preparing a wall for a graphic, keep in mind that not all surfaces are suitable for vinyl film application.\nWall graphics can be applied successfully only to surfaces that are clean, dry, smooth and non-porous. Any\nof the following conditions can cause poor adhesion or product failure:\n\n\u2022 Highly textured paint\n\u2022 Poor initial paint bond\n\u2022 Poorly painted wall edges\n\u2022 Patched areas that have not been primed before painting\n\u2022 Moisture behind the drywall, which can cause the drywall paper to release. Walls with cooling\nsystems or water pipes behind them may be prone to condensation.\n\u2022 High humidity areas including (but not limited to) garages, entryways, and bathrooms\n\u2022 Dust, dirt, or other contaminants on the wall\n\u2022 Wallpaper or other wall coverings\n\u2022 Cuts made to the graphic during the installation process may cause curling or lifting.\n\u2022 Freshly painted walls that have not had ample time to cure. Wall graphics tend to bubble and\nrelease from the wall while paint is in the curing process.\n\nWhen applying graphics to heavily tinted paints that have more than 1 oz. of tint per gallon, keep in\nmind that the surfactants (AKA TI02 or Titanium Dioxide) and colorants that make up darker paint\ncolors often take longer to outgas. Avoid matte or flat finish latex paints and paints that use\nanti-graffiti agents. When applying the paint, use a 3\/8\u201d nap roller cover to reduce stippling.\nOnce the paint has had ample time to cure, it\u2019s important to clean the surface immediately before\napplying the film. Dust and other contaminants can collect quickly on the wall and prevent the film\nfrom adhering properly. Wipe down the wall with a dry tack cloth or a lint-free microfiber cloth to\nremove any dust, paying attention to the wall\u2019s edges and corners.","creation_tsz":1466714503,"ending_tsz":1477255303,"original_creation_tsz":1447227626,"last_modified_tsz":1466714503,"price":"25.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":11,"tags":["at at decal","boy with at at decal","star wars decal","star war decal","indoor at at decal","at at wall decal","at at wall vinyl","star wars wall vinyl","star wars wall decal","star war indoor","indoor wall decal","landwalker decal","landwalker indoor"],"category_path":["Housewares","Home Decor"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,68892008],"materials":["wall decal","indoor vinyl","indoor wall vinyl","wall sticker","indoor wall sticker","indoor wall decal","indoor sticker"],"shop_section_id":17669633,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1447227626,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/255758766\/boy-walking-at-at-wall-decal-boy-and-his?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":663,"num_favorers":76,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"16","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1986,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Decals & Murals","Murals"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":866354569,"hex_code":"AEAAA5","red":174,"green":170,"blue":165,"hue":33,"saturation":5,"brightness":68,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1447227627,"listing_id":255758766,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/105\/0\/8928591\/il_75x75.866354569_rjgs.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/105\/0\/8928591\/il_170x135.866354569_rjgs.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/105\/0\/8928591\/il_570xN.866354569_rjgs.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/105\/0\/8928591\/il_fullxfull.866354569_rjgs.jpg","full_height":734,"full_width":1090},{"listing_image_id":866590134,"hex_code":"71716D","red":113,"green":113,"blue":109,"hue":60,"saturation":3,"brightness":44,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1447227627,"listing_id":255758766,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/128\/0\/8928591\/il_75x75.866590134_m74v.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/128\/0\/8928591\/il_170x135.866590134_m74v.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/128\/0\/8928591\/il_570xN.866590134_m74v.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/128\/0\/8928591\/il_fullxfull.866590134_m74v.jpg","full_height":1067,"full_width":1490}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8928591,"shop_name":"TheVinylGoods","user_id":41805476,"creation_tsz":1387233785,"title":"College Mascots, Custom Star Wars, etc., all right here","announcement":"Need something customized?

That generally adds an extra $2.00-$5.00 to shipping charges. \r\n\r\nFor International Buyers: Please contact us before purchasing for a shipping quote to your area. Thanks! \r\n\r\nShipping does include insurance. $50 is the standard for most items, but I always insure up to the package&#39;s worth. That is also calculated into your shipping costs. \r\n\r\nFinally, I calculate shipping based on the furthest distance from me in the continental US (which would be California). This makes for much higher shipping prices on large items. If you are near my home state (Michigan), and want to purchase a large item, send me your city name and zip code so I can give you a more accurate shipping price. Also, if you are within 4 hours from us, we can deliver on especially large items (like our scales).

Go here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.Lennymud.etsy.com \r\n\r\nHello Fabulous People!  I like to create happy stuff that makes people smile. \r\nHere are answers to the most commonly asked questions about my shop:\r\n\r\nWHAT IS UP WITH SHIPPING COSTS?\r\nShipping is based on weight and destination. I have recently switched to Etsy&#39;s calculated shipping.  This program bases the cost of shipping on how far away you are from me (in New Jersey) an dhow much your item weighs--the average mug is 2 lbs. when boxed.  This mean that East Coast people are getting huge savings, while those of you on the West Coast may be clutching your chest and wondering what the heck happened.  Before you send me a note demanding to know why sometimes the cost to ship far away is sometimes more than the cost of the item itself;  please be aware that I do not rule the world and do not set the current postal rates.  IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY ON SHIPPING order multiple items!  While 2lbs, (or a single mug) will cost $ 10.77, you can have TWO MUGS shipped Medium Flat Rate for $ 11.95. Or have three items shipped UPS for $ 14.00.  If you have any questions please leave me a message in the &quot;note to seller&quot; field at checkout.  I REFUND ALL SHIPPING OVERAGES TO YOUR METHOD OF PAYMENT.   \r\n\r\nCAN I SEND IT TO SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF?\r\nAbsolutely!  Happy to help you make someone else happy!  Etsy will let you enter in a different ship to address- please leave me a note at checkout that you would like me to include with the item instead of a receipt so that they know it is a gift from you.  I wrap for safety in bubble and clean brown kraft paper, I do not gift wrap, sorry!  \r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER EXPEDITED SHIPPING?\r\nSo sorry-  I do not offer expedited shipping--but I do rush your order out the door as quickly as possible!! I often ship NEXT DAY (not on weekends, tho) Average shipping times are: USA East Coast 1-3 days, West Coast 3-5 days, Canada 2 weeks, Europe and AU 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nDO YOU WHOLESALE\r\nSo sorry- I have a great day job as a designer for a line of ceramics sold world wide.   My employment contract prohibits me from engaging in any wholesale activities regardless of how different my handmade, weekend work is.  Sorry to disappoint!\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE CUSTOM ORDERS\r\nDue to my shop volume, I do not take custom orders- so sorry to disappoint.  I hope you can find another Etsy seller to help you.\r\n\r\nBecause this is not my day job, I can be slow to answer convos.  Apologies in advance for any delay in responding to your inquiries. Please mark anything particularly time sensitive with URGENT.  I also welcome any URGENT messages be texted to me at 917 921 6142.  I will not accept your phone call as I have difficulty hearing, but am happy to respond to an urgent text. \r\n\r\nI use all lead free, non toxic, eco friendly clays and glazes.  Testing certificates available upon request.  All items are made to be used and enjoyed- dishwasher and microwave safe.  I ship using recycled materials and do not use styrofoam peanuts because those things are bad for our planet! And they are a bear to clean up if you have a shag carpet--am I right?\r\n\r\nIf you are in Philadelphia or New Jersey you can come by and pick your items up in person if you&#39;d like-- my studio is located in Haddonfield New Jersey- just 15 minutes from Philly. \r\nFollow me on Twitter- LorrieMud\r\nOn Facebook http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Lennymud\/179831098733257\r\nAnd pinterest Lennymud\r\nAnd Instagram\r\n","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

We recommend - wash your t shirt inside out with warm water and hang dry.\n\n\u27ba FEEDBACK: \nWe appreciate every feedback. Please contact us before leaving any negative feedback - we believe that there is a reasonable explanation in most of the cases and we also believe that we will be able to resolve the issue if both parties communicate properly.
